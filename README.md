# real_or_not

This project builds an ML model to classify whether or not a tweet is about a real disaster.

I haven't done any NLP projects for a while, so I'll work on the Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview to refresh my knowledge.

## Requirements

The code is run in Python 3.8, please find the package requirements in requirements.txt
